        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 24px auto; text-align: center">
          Paws in the Park is a community event that brings together animal
          lovers, families, and pets of all ages to celebrate the bond between
          people and their animal companions.
        </p>
        <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; text-align: center">
          Hosted in partnership with animal welfare organizations, this event
          raises awareness about responsible pet ownership, supports rescue
          groups, and benefits programs that provide shelter, care, and adoption
          opportunities for animals in need.
        </p>
        <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 16px auto; text-align: center">
          It is a celebration of compassion, connection, and community where
          laughter, fun, and love for animals take the stage.

        <h2>About Paws in the Park</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto">
          Paws in the Park is more than a fun day in the park. It is a
          celebration of kindness toward animals and the people who love them.
          All proceeds and community support help fund animal welfare programs,
          including shelter care, pet adoption, responsible ownership education,
          and compassionate services for animals in need.
        </p>
        <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 16px auto 0">
          The event unites volunteers, rescue groups, sponsors, and animal
          lovers with one shared goal: to make a difference for pets and
          families alike.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Choice in Creating this Website</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto">
          Purpose & Theme: The focus was to make the poster look organic. The
          flight of the birds and the flowing grass shows fluid movement, which
          gives the poster life and directs the eye. The utilization of brighter
          but still warm and cohesive color palettes, attracts attention. This
          targets families and children, which gives it a heartwarming and
          welcoming tone. Audience Impact: The subject, the dog, is placed in
          the foreground for focus. The drawing of the dog also smiles, giving
          the impression of a family-friendly and wholesome event. Rounded
          clouds and fluffy textures avoid sharpness, making it appear softer
          and more welcoming. • Design Choices: Rounded fonts for body text are
          modernized, easy to read, and organized. Headings use brush fonts that
          give the impression of movement and energy. The spacing also feels
          open and freeing, like being outside in nature.
